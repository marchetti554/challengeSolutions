#### Hi! I'm Marco Marchetti, a Software Engineer born in Argentina.

I'm **currently looking for a new job**, and in order to practice for my several future interviews (:crossed_fingers:),
I created
this repository where I will be uploading my solutions to many programming exercises.

If you have any suggestion feel free to contact me! Feedback will always be appreciated :wink:
